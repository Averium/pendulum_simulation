# Double Inverted Pendulum Simulation

This project is a **double inverted pendulum** simulation built using **C++** and **Raylib**. The main purpose of the project is to practice simulation techniques and improve proficiency in C++.

## Features

- Simulates a double inverted pendulum system with user-defined physical parameters.
- Real-time simulation and rendering with Raylib.
- Adjustable parameters for experimenting with different physical scenarios.
- Threading support for running physics updates independently of the rendering loop.

## Requirements

- **Raylib** (for rendering and window management)
- **C++20 or higher**
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
